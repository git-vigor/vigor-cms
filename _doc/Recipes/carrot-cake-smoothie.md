Tastes like a chilled smooth form of carrot cake mixed with pumpkin pie. The fats from coconut and hemp create the perfect consistency.

## Ingredients

* 1 large carrot OR Â¼ cup baby carrots (chopped or shredded)
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional)
* 1 tablespoon coconut butter (or coconut flakes)
* 2 tablespoon raw walnut pieces
* 7-10 drops plain or vanilla stevia liquid, to your taste
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1 cup unsweetened almond or coconut milk
* 1 scoop Vanilla protein powder or collagen powder

## Directions

Combine all ingredients in a high-speed blender and blend until perfectly smooth, scraping down sides a couple of times if necessary (for a cold smoothie, add 2-3 ice cubes). Pour into a large glass and garnish with a sprinkle more cinnamon, if desired.
